# The Drone Syndicate

Modular drone research project — progressive capability building from autonomous flight to military-grade payloads.

## Phase 1 — Autonomous Drone with Onboard AI

Drone that flies autonomously, detects anomalies mid-flight, switches to local AI when jammed, controllable over the internet from anywhere.

| # | Variant | Approx Budget (INR) |
|---|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | Budget Build (Orange Pi 5) — 6 TOPS NPU, local object detection | 32,000 - 35,000 |
| 2 | Mid-Range (Jetson Nano) — 128 CUDA cores, YOLOv5 @ 30+ FPS | 55,000 - 60,000 |
| 3 | Ultra Budget (Raspberry Pi 4) — MobileNet-SSD @ 2-5 FPS | 28,000 - 32,000 |
| 4 | Premium Research (Jetson Orin Nano) — 67 TOPS, YOLOv8 @ 40+ FPS | 85,000 - 95,000 |
| 5 | Fiber-Optic Tethered (Unjammable) — immune to EMP/jamming, 1-5km range | 50,000 - 70,000 |
| 6 | GPS-Denied Navigation (VIO/SLAM) — flies without GPS using cameras + IMU | 75,000 - 95,000 |

## Phase 2 — RF Surveillance & Wireless Security Research

Add SDR/RF capabilities to the Phase 1 drone for spectrum monitoring, signal intelligence, and authorized security testing.

| # | Variant | Additional Cost (INR) |
|---|---------|---------------------|
| 1 | Passive RF Spectrum Monitor — wide-band signal logging, no transmit | +10,000 - 18,000 |
| 2 | WiFi Network Audit — airborne wireless pentesting platform | +5,000 - 10,000 |
| 3 | Multi-Spectrum Surveillance — thermal + enhanced optical, day/night | +15,000 - 25,000 |
| 4 | Counter-UAS Detection — detect & track other drones via RF + acoustic + AI | +12,000 - 20,000 |
| 5 | Electronic Warfare / SIGINT Research — passive SIGINT, 1MHz-6GHz analysis | +20,000 - 35,000 |

## Phase 3 — Military Payload Systems

Mission-specific payloads inspired by real defense contractor systems.

| # | Variant | Additional Cost (INR) |
|---|---------|---------------------|
| 1 | ISR Sensor Pod — stabilized gimbal, thermal + optical, target tracking | +10,000 - 50,000 |
| 2 | Comms Relay / Mesh Node — flying radio relay for ground units | +5,000 - 12,000 |
| 3 | Counter-Drone Interceptor — autonomous pursuit & net capture | +15,000 - 30,000 |
| 4 | Military Forward Resupply — autonomous supply delivery under fire | +12,000 - 25,000 |
| 5 | Battlefield Search & Rescue — thermal + AI to find wounded, drop supplies | +12,000 - 20,000 |
| 6 | EW Decoy / Countermeasure Dispenser — electronic decoys, chaff, IR countermeasures | +15,000 - 25,000 |
