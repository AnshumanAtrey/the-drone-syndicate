    MOTOR VERIFICATION REPORT - HEAVY-LIFT HEXACOPTER (3kg PAYLOAD)
    Independent Research & Safety Analysis
    Date: February 2026
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  Verify whether 3508-class 380KV motors can safely lift a 3kg payload
  on a hexacopter. Minimum required thrust-to-weight ratio: 1.5:1,
  target 1.7:1 or better. This is a SAFETY-CRITICAL analysis.

CRITICAL NOTE ON DATA DISCREPANCY:
  The earlier T-Motor store page showed 1160g max thrust with 15x5 props.
  This was INCORRECT -- that figure was for the 12x4 CF prop, not 15x5.
  The VERIFIED maximum with 15x5 CF props on 6S is 1,880g at 13.3A.
  This was confirmed through the full official data table extraction
  which shows ALL propeller configurations side by side.

RELIABILITY:
  - T-Motor is the industry standard for professional multirotor motors
  - EZO bearings are the gold standard in the RC motor industry
  - 1000-hour MTBF is among the best in class
  - Widely used in ArduPilot community builds
  - Referenced in academic research (ResearchGate published papers)
  - Users on ArduPilot forums have built F550/680 hexacopters with these
    motors carrying payloads successfully

VERDICT: VERIFIED AND RECOMMENDED. Best combination of documented
         performance data, reliability, and community support.
         Price: ~$45-55 USD each.

MOTOR 2: SunnySky V3508 380KV (VERIFIED - GOOD ALTERNATIVE)
================================================================================

SOURCE: SunnySky USA official store (sunnyskyusa.com), himodel.com,
        getfpv.com product listings.
STATUS: VERIFIED from manufacturer data. Less independent test data
        available compared to T-Motor.

--- SPECIFICATIONS ---
  KV Rating:            380 RPM/V
  Weight:               97g (stated on official page)
  Stator Diameter:      35mm
  Rotor Diameter:       41.8mm
  Stator Thickness:     8mm
  Body Length:          20mm
  Internal Resistance:  257 milliohm (HIGHER than T-Motor's 205m)
  Max Continuous Current: 16A/30s (NOTE: 30-second rating, not 180s!)
  Max Continuous Power:   400W
  Idle Current:         0.3A @ 10V
  LiPo Compatibility:   4-6S
  Recommended ESC:      30A
  Recommended Takeoff Wt: <=800g per motor

--- MANUFACTURER THRUST DATA: 6S (22.2V) WITH CN15x5.5 PROPELLER ---

  RPM:        5,463
  Current:    13.4A
  Thrust:     1,840g
  Power:      297W
  Efficiency: 6.19 g/W
  Temperature: 115C after 1 minute (WARNING - see below)

CONCERNS:
  1. THERMAL: The manufacturer reports 115C after just 1 minute at
     full throttle with CN15x5.5 props. This is VERY HOT and near the
     limit of most magnet wire insulation (~155C for Class F). This
     motor is running much hotter than the T-Motor at similar thrust.

  2. CURRENT RATING: The 16A/30s rating means max current is only
     sustainable for 30 seconds, NOT the 180 seconds (3 minutes)
     that T-Motor rates. This is a significant difference for
     sustained heavy-lift operations.

  3. RESISTANCE: At 257 milliohm vs T-Motor's 205 milliohm, the
     SunnySky has 25% higher internal resistance, meaning more heat
     generation for the same current.

  4. LESS INDEPENDENT DATA: While the manufacturer data looks good,
     there are far fewer independent thrust bench tests published
     compared to T-Motor.

  5. PROP COMPATIBILITY: Uses CN15x5.5 (EOLO brand) propellers vs
     T-Motor's own 15x5 CF props. Propeller availability may be
     more limited.

RELIABILITY:
  - SunnySky is a well-regarded Chinese manufacturer
  - Japanese EZO bearings (same as T-Motor)
  - Each motor dynamically balanced, 3% performance tolerance
  - Patented stepped/knurled design prevents loosening
  - Used in many DIY builds, but less professional/commercial adoption

VERDICT: GOOD alternative if T-Motor is unavailable or budget is tight.
         The thermal concerns at max thrust are notable -- this motor
         is working harder to achieve similar thrust. For a heavy-lift
         application where you may hover at 55-60% throttle, thermals
         should be manageable, but the margin is smaller.
         Price: ~$25-35 USD each (cheaper than T-Motor).

MOTOR 3: GARTT ML3508 380KV (NOT VERIFIED - CONCERNS)
================================================================================

SOURCE: Multiple searches across AliExpress, Amazon, Alibaba, GARTT
        official site (garttmodel.com), hobby retailer sites.
STATUS: COULD NOT VERIFY. The GARTT ML3508 380KV may not exist as a
        standard product.

--- FINDINGS ---

  After extensive searching, the GARTT ML3508 is widely available in:
    - 700KV variant (for 3-4S, DJI E600 replacement)
    - 580KV variant (for 4S applications)

  The 380KV variant DOES NOT appear in standard GARTT product listings.
  GARTT does make a ML4108 380KV (larger stator, 46mm diameter).

  There IS a listing on AliExpress for "GARTT ML3508 370KV" (close to
  380KV), which may be what was referenced. However:

  GARTT ML3508 580KV specifications (for reference):
    Motor KV:         580 RPM/V
    Weight:           ~105g
    Motor Resistance: 0.1098 ohm
    Max Current:      25A
    Max Power:        400W
    Shaft Diameter:   3.175mm (SMALLER than T-Motor's 4mm!)
    Max LiPo:        4S (NOT 6S rated!)
    Idle Current:     0.4A/10V
    Motor Diameter:   42mm

  GARTT ML4108 380KV specifications:
    Motor Resistance: 0.1932 ohm
    Max Current:      18A
    Max Power:        430W
    Motor Diameter:   46mm
    Idle Current:     0.4A/10V

CONCERNS:
  1. PRODUCT EXISTENCE: Cannot confirm ML3508 380KV exists as a
     standard SKU from GARTT. May be a rebranded/relabeled motor.

  2. NO THRUST DATA: Zero published thrust test data found for any
     GARTT ML3508 at 380KV with 15" propellers on 6S.

  3. SHAFT SIZE: The ML3508 580KV uses a 3.175mm shaft (1/8 inch),
     which is SMALLER than the standard 4mm shaft on T-Motor/SunnySky.
     A smaller shaft may not handle 15" prop loads as well.

  4. VOLTAGE LIMIT: The ML3508 580KV is rated for 4S max. The 380KV
     variant (if it exists) may or may not be rated for 6S.

  5. QUALITY CONTROL: GARTT motors are significantly cheaper (~$15-20
     each). Multiple Amazon reviews of GARTT ML3508 700KV motors
     mention:
     - Motor-to-motor inconsistency
     - Bearing noise after moderate use
     - Generally functional but noticeably lower quality than T-Motor

VERDICT: NOT RECOMMENDED for safety-critical applications.
         Cannot verify specifications. No thrust data available.
         Unknown 6S compatibility. For a non-critical hobby build,
         GARTT motors can work, but for carrying 3kg payloads where
         motor failure means a crash, the risk is not justified when
         T-Motor and SunnySky options exist.

MOTOR 4: BrotherHobby Avenger 3508 380KV (DOES NOT EXIST)
================================================================================

SOURCE: BrotherHobby official store (brotherhobbystore.com), getfpv.com,
        racedayquads.com, pyrodrone.com, multiple retailer searches.
STATUS: THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT EXIST.

--- FINDINGS ---

  BrotherHobby's Avenger series includes the following stator sizes:
    - Avenger 2806.5 (1300KV, 1700KV)
    - Avenger 2812 V3 (1115KV and other options)
    - Avenger 3008 (1150KV, 1300KV, 1500KV, 1900KV)
    - Avenger 3120 (500KV, 700KV)
    - Avenger 4215 V5 (390KV, 435KV, 555KV)

  There is NO "Avenger 3508" in BrotherHobby's product line. The
  closest alternatives would be:
    - Avenger 3120 700KV (30mm stator, not 35mm)
    - Avenger 4215 390KV (larger 42mm stator, close KV, but much
      bigger/heavier motor designed for 7-8" cinematography quads)

VERDICT: DOES NOT EXIST. Cannot be evaluated. If a "BrotherHobby 3508"
         is being sold somewhere, it is likely a counterfeit or
         mislabeled product from a third-party seller.

------------------------------------|-----|-------------|----------
Frame (Tarot 680 PRO or similar)    |  1  |   1,200     |  1,200
  NOTE: Your 1200g estimate is conservative. Tarot 680 PRO is ~780g.
  Using 1200g as stated for a heavier/custom frame.
Motors (T-Motor MN3508 380KV)       |  6  |    103      |    618
  NOTE: Your estimate of 650g total is close (618g actual).
ESCs (40A, e.g. T-Motor AIR 40A)    |  6  |     28      |    168
  NOTE: Your 200g total estimate is reasonable (168g actual).
FC + GPS (Pixhawk + M8N)            |  1  |     68      |     68
  NOTE: Your 150g estimate is conservative (actual ~68g).
Battery (6S 10000mAh)               |  1  |   1,350     |  1,350
  NOTE: Your 800g estimate is SIGNIFICANTLY LOW. A 6S 10000mAh
  LiPo typically weighs 1,100-1,400g. Using Tattu data: 1,350g.
  A 6S 5000mAh would be ~730g, closer to your estimate.
Servos (6x MG90S)                   |  6  |     14      |     84
  NOTE: Your 90g estimate is close (84g actual).

TOTAL (with your 1200g frame):                          |  7,040g

TOTAL (with Tarot 680 PRO 780g frame):                  |  6,620g

--- YOUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATE vs CORRECTED ---

  Your estimate:     ~6,390g
    (1200+650+200+150+800+90+3000+300)

  Major correction:  Battery weight. Your 800g estimate only works for
    a 6S 5000mAh battery (~730g). A 10000mAh 6S weighs ~1,350g.

  Corrected with 10Ah battery:  ~7,040g  (with 1200g frame)
  Corrected with 5Ah battery:   ~5,690g  (with 1200g frame)
  Corrected with 10Ah + 780g frame: ~6,620g

  RECOMMENDATION: Use the 780g Tarot 680 PRO frame weight for
  calculation, but ADD a 10-15% contingency for unforeseen additions.

  Working estimate: 6,620g + 10% contingency = ~7,280g

--- SAFETY ASSESSMENT ---

  YOUR MINIMUM REQUIREMENT: 1.5:1 TWR
  YOUR TARGET: 1.7:1 TWR

  With the most conservative estimate (7,280g AUW with contingency):
    TWR = 1.55:1  --> BARELY meets your 1.5:1 minimum
    Hover at ~65% throttle --> limited headroom for maneuvers
    NOT recommended for windy conditions

  With realistic estimate (6,620g with Tarot 680):
    TWR = 1.70:1  --> EXACTLY meets your 1.7:1 target
    Hover at ~59% throttle --> acceptable for calm conditions
    Wind tolerance: ~15 km/h max

  INDUSTRY STANDARD RECOMMENDATIONS:
    - ArduPilot community: 2:1 MINIMUM, 3:1 preferred
    - Tyto Robotics drone design guide: 2:1 minimum
    - One ArduPilot expert quote: "2:1 is the minimum"
    - Below 2:1, PID control loops lose precision at low throttle
    - Below 1.5:1, the drone may struggle to maintain altitude
      in gusts and has essentially zero climb authority when loaded

CRITICAL FINDING:
  The 3508 380KV motors at 1,880g thrust each are MARGINAL for your
  application. They technically meet your stated requirements (1.5-1.7:1)
  but fall SHORT of industry-recommended minimums (2:1).

  The hover throttle of 59-65% means:
    - 35-41% throttle headroom for climbing, wind compensation
    - In a gust, the drone may need 80%+ throttle momentarily
    - If one motor fails on a hex, remaining 5 motors need ~20% more
      thrust each -- at 65% hover, that pushes to ~78% per motor
    - Battery voltage sag under load further reduces available thrust
    - Propeller efficiency drops at high throttle percentages

================================================================================
SECTION: UPGRADE OPTIONS FOR BETTER SAFETY MARGIN
================================================================================

If 3508 380KV is truly marginal, here are verified upgrade paths:

--- OPTION A: T-Motor MN3510 360KV (STEP UP - MODEST IMPROVEMENT) ---

  Weight: 97g (no cables), 117-119g (with cables)
  Max Thrust (15x5 CF, 6S): 1,900g @ 12.5A
  Max Continuous Current: 15A (180s)
  Max Power: 330W
  Efficiency at max: 6.85 g/W

  6-motor total thrust: 11,400g
  TWR at 6,620g AUW: 1.72:1  (minimal improvement over MN3508)

  VERDICT: Only ~20g more thrust per motor. NOT worth the upgrade
  cost for such a small gain. Same class of motor with slightly
  taller stator (10mm vs 8mm).

--- OPTION B: T-Motor MN4012 400KV (SIGNIFICANT UPGRADE) ---

  Weight: 134g (no cables), 155g (with cables)
  Max Thrust (15x5 CF, 6S): 2,370g @ 16.2A
  Max Thrust (16x5.4 CF, 6S): 3,020g @ 22.5A
  Max Continuous Current: 25A (180s)
  Max Power: 750W
  Internal Resistance: 67 milliohm (MUCH lower than MN3508's 205m)
  Configuration: 18N24P
  Dimensions: 44.7mm dia x 34.5mm
  MTBF: ~1000 hours

  6-motor total thrust (15x5): 14,220g
  6-motor total thrust (16x5.4): 18,120g

  Weight penalty: 6 x (155-103) = +312g total (extra motor weight)
  Adjusted AUW: 6,620 + 312 = 6,932g

  TWR at 6,932g (15x5 props): 14,220 / 6,932 = 2.05:1  MEETS 2:1!
  TWR at 6,932g (16x5.4 props): 18,120 / 6,932 = 2.61:1  EXCELLENT!

  VERDICT: STRONGLY RECOMMENDED for safety-critical applications.
  The MN4012 provides genuine 2:1+ TWR with 15" props, and an
  outstanding 2.6:1 with 16" props. The weight penalty is modest
  (312g for all 6 motors). Requires 30A ESCs instead of 40A.
  Needs a frame that can accommodate 15-16" propellers.
  Price: ~$55-75 USD each (more expensive but justified for safety).

--- OPTION C: T-Motor MN4014 400KV (MAXIMUM SAFETY) ---

  Max Thrust (15x5 CF, 6S): ~2,620g
  Max Thrust (16x5.4 CF, 6S): ~3,020g+
  Weight: ~171g (with cables)

  6-motor total thrust: 15,720g - 18,120g
  Even with heavier frame (Tarot 960, ~1,200g), TWR would be 2.0-2.3:1

  VERDICT: Overkill for 3kg payload unless you want maximum safety
  margin. Consider if budget allows and frame supports 16" props.

--- OPTION D: Use 14x4.8 Props Instead of 15x5 (DOWNGRADE PROPS) ---

  If frame geometry limits you to 14" propellers:
  T-Motor MN3508 380KV with 14x4.8 CF on 6S: 1,730g max thrust
  6-motor total: 10,380g
  TWR at 6,620g: 1.57:1  (WORSE - barely meets minimum)

  VERDICT: If using 14" props, you MUST upgrade to MN4012 class motors.

================================================================================
SECTION: FINAL RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

--- FOR YOUR STATED 1.5:1 MINIMUM / 1.7:1 TARGET ---

  The T-Motor MN3508 380KV with 15x5 CF propellers on 6S DOES meet
  your stated requirements, achieving 1.70:1 TWR with a Tarot 680 Pro
  frame and realistic weight estimates. However:

  1. This is EXACTLY at your target with ZERO margin for error.
  2. Add a slightly heavier battery or unexpected wiring weight and
     you drop below 1.7:1.
  3. Industry consensus is that 2:1 is the TRUE minimum for safe,
     controllable flight with a payload.
  4. Battery voltage sag (6S starts at 25.2V, nominal 22.2V, low
     at 21.0V) means thrust drops ~10-15% from published data
     at the end of flight.

--- IF THIS IS TRULY SAFETY-CRITICAL, MY RECOMMENDATION IS: ---

  PRIMARY: T-Motor MN4012 400KV
    - 6 motors x 2,370g = 14,220g total thrust (15" props)
    - AUW ~6,932g with 10Ah battery
    - TWR = 2.05:1 (with 15" props)
    - TWR = 2.61:1 (with 16" props)
    - Genuine safety margin for wind, voltage sag, and motor failure
    - 155g per motor, 30A ESCs required
    - Additional cost: ~$60-120 total over MN3508 option

  FALLBACK: T-Motor MN3508 380KV
    - Acceptable if budget is constrained AND you:
      a) Use the lighter 5Ah battery (TWR = 2.14:1 with 780g frame)
      b) Limit payload to 2.5kg instead of 3kg
      c) Only fly in calm conditions (<15 km/h wind)
      d) Accept reduced mission time with lighter battery

  AVOID: GARTT ML3508 (unverified, quality concerns)
  AVOID: BrotherHobby Avenger 3508 (does not exist)
  ACCEPTABLE: SunnySky V3508 380KV (verified thrust, thermal concerns,
              use only if T-Motor unavailable)
