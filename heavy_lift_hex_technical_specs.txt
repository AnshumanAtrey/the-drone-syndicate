  Throttle | Total Current | Total Thrust
     50%   |   21.6A       |   4,920g  (4.92 kg)
     65%   |   36.6A       |   7,200g  (7.20 kg)
     75%   |   57.0A       |   9,000g  (9.00 kg)

    100%   |   79.8A       |  11,280g  (11.28 kg)

ANALYSIS:
- At 50% throttle (hover), 6 motors produce ~4.92 kg of thrust
- This means the drone can hover a total AUW of ~4.9 kg at 50% throttle
- At 65% throttle: 7.2 kg hover capacity
- Thrust-to-weight ratio at 8 kg AUW: 11.28/8.0 = 1.41:1
  (Minimum recommended for multirotors is 2:1, so 8 kg is the safe upper limit
   where the hex would hover at ~70-75% throttle)

Recommended ESC: T-Motor AIR 40A (40A max, 22.2V max)

    100%   |   ~96.6A      |  ~8,160g  (8.16 kg)

ANALYSIS:
- Max total thrust: ~8.16 kg (6 x 1,360g with 12" props)
- For 3-4 kg payload, AUW ~7-8 kg, this is marginal
- Higher thrust achievable with 13" props (~9,600g total)
- CAUTION: 4S limits voltage headroom; 6S is much better for this motor class
- Current draw is HIGH on 4S - requires 30A+ ESCs and high C-rate battery

Recommended ESC: 30A minimum (BLHeli_32 or similar)

    100%   |   ~90A        |  ~5,700g  (5.70 kg)

ANALYSIS:
- Max total thrust: ~5.7 kg (6 x 950g)
- For 2:1 thrust-to-weight ratio, max AUW = ~2.85 kg
- NOT RECOMMENDED for 3-4 kg payload carrying
- These motors are designed for 450-class quads weighing 1.5-2.5 kg
- With 3 kg payload + 2.5 kg dry weight = 5.5 kg AUW
- Thrust-to-weight ratio: 5.7/5.5 = 1.04:1 (DANGEROUS - cannot fly safely)
- VERDICT: INADEQUATE for this mission. Use only for sub-1kg payloads.

Config C: No payload               =     0g

--- ALL-UP WEIGHTS ---

With 6S 10000mAh battery:
  Full payload AUW:     3,465 + 3,000 = 6,465g  (6.47 kg)
  Half payload AUW:     3,465 + 1,500 = 4,965g  (4.97 kg)
  No payload AUW:       3,465 + 0     = 3,465g  (3.47 kg)

With 6S 5000mAh battery (saving ~600g):
  Battery weight:       ~730g (vs 1,350g)
  Dry weight adjusted:  2,845g

--- THRUST-TO-WEIGHT RATIOS (Option A: 3508 380KV, 15x5, 6S) ---

  Configuration          | AUW    | Max Thrust | TWR   | Hover Throttle
  -----------------------|--------|------------|-------|---------------
  Full payload, 10Ah     | 6.47kg | 11.28kg    | 1.74  |   ~57%
  Full payload, 5Ah      | 5.85kg | 11.28kg    | 1.93  |   ~52%

  No payload, 5Ah        | 2.85kg | 11.28kg    | 3.96  |   ~25%

NOTES:
- TWR of 1.74:1 at full load is functional but leaves limited margin
- Recommended minimum TWR for multirotors: 2:1
- The 5Ah battery option with full payload gives 1.93:1 - acceptable
- As payloads are dropped, TWR improves dramatically
- At half payload, the hex has excellent 2.27:1 ratio

================================================================================
SECTION 5: FLIGHT TIME ESTIMATES
================================================================================

Formula: Flight Time (min) = (Battery Capacity Ah x 0.80) / Avg Current Draw x 60

Where:
- 0.80 = 80% usable capacity (20% reserve for LiPo safety)
- Avg Current Draw = current at hover throttle for given AUW

--- SCENARIO 1: 6S 10000mAh WITH 3 kg PAYLOAD (AUW ~6.47 kg) ---

  Hover throttle: ~57%
  Current per motor at 57%: ~4.5A (interpolated from data)
  Total hover current: ~27A
  Flight time: (10.0 x 0.80) / 27 x 60 = 17.8 minutes

  Practical flight time (with maneuvering): ~14-16 minutes

--- SCENARIO 2: 6S 5000mAh WITH 3 kg PAYLOAD (AUW ~5.85 kg) ---

  Hover throttle: ~52%
  Current per motor at 52%: ~3.8A
  Total hover current: ~23A
  Flight time: (5.0 x 0.80) / 23 x 60 = 10.4 minutes

  Practical flight time: ~8-9 minutes

--- SCENARIO 3: 6S 10000mAh WITHOUT PAYLOAD (AUW ~3.47 kg) ---

  Hover throttle: ~31%
  Current per motor at 31%: ~1.8A (very efficient)
  Total hover current: ~10.8A
  Flight time: (10.0 x 0.80) / 10.8 x 60 = 44.4 minutes

  Practical flight time: ~30-35 minutes

--- SCENARIO 4: PROGRESSIVE PAYLOAD DROP (realistic mission) ---

  Start: 6.47 kg AUW, hover at ~57%, ~27A total
  After drop 1 (5.97 kg): ~53%, ~25A
  After drop 2 (5.47 kg): ~49%, ~23A
  After drop 3 (4.97 kg): ~45%, ~21A
  After drop 4 (4.47 kg): ~40%, ~18A
  After drop 5 (3.97 kg): ~36%, ~15A
  After drop 6 (3.47 kg): ~31%, ~11A

  Average current across full mission: ~20A
  Flight time with 10Ah: (10.0 x 0.80) / 20 x 60 = 24 minutes
  Practical: ~18-20 minutes for full 6-drop mission

================================================================================
SECTION 6: MULTI-PAYLOAD RELEASE MECHANISM DESIGN
================================================================================

--- CONCEPT OVERVIEW ---

6 individual servo-actuated payload bays, each holding one 500g package,
mounted radially on the hexacopter frame between/below the motor arms.

--- MECHANICAL DESIGN ---

Each release unit consists of:
  1. One MG90S metal-gear micro servo (13.4g, 2.2 kg-cm torque at 4.8V)
  2. A 3D-printed payload cradle/hook bracket (~15g)
  3. A locking pin or rotating hook mechanism
  4. Mounting hardware (M2/M3 screws, standoffs)

Mechanism Types (choose one):

  A) PIN-PULL RELEASE (Simplest):
     - Servo rotates to pull a steel pin (2mm dia) out of a loop
     - Payload hangs on a loop/carabiner held by the pin
     - Pro: Simple, reliable, lightweight
     - Con: Cannot re-engage in flight

  B) ROTATING HOOK RELEASE:
     - Servo rotates a hook from "closed" to "open" position
     - Payload cord sits in the hook notch
     - Pro: Can re-engage, more secure
     - Con: Slightly more complex 3D print

  C) SLIDING GATE RELEASE:
     - Servo moves a sliding gate that blocks/unblocks a slot
     - Payload cord passes through slot
     - Pro: Very secure, positive lock
     - Con: More friction, heavier

RECOMMENDED: Option A (Pin-Pull) for simplicity and reliability.

--- MOUNTING LAYOUT ---

           \       /
            Motor 4

  [R1]-[R6] = Release mechanisms mounted between motor arms

  Mounting Options:
  - Underneath the main plate, between arms (preferred)
  - On the landing gear crossbars
  - On a custom payload rail attached to the center plate

  CLEARANCE: Each payload hangs 100-150mm below the frame.
  Ensure landing gear height accommodates payload + ground clearance.
  Tarot 680 PRO has 180mm ground clearance - adequate for small packages.

--- WIRING ---

  Each MG90S servo requires:
  - Signal wire (to receiver/FC PWM output)
  - +5V power (from BEC, NOT from receiver directly)
  - Ground

  IMPORTANT: Do NOT power 6 servos from the receiver's 5V rail.
  Use a dedicated BEC (Battery Eliminator Circuit) rated for 3A+ at 5V.
  A 5A BEC is recommended for 6 servos (peak current ~6A during actuation).

SECTION 7: RC TX/RX CHANNEL REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

--- CHANNEL ALLOCATION ---

  Channel  | Function         | Control Input
  ---------|------------------|-------------------
  CH1      | Aileron (Roll)   | Right stick X
  CH2      | Elevator (Pitch) | Right stick Y
  CH3      | Throttle         | Left stick Y
  CH4      | Rudder (Yaw)     | Left stick X
  CH5      | Flight Mode      | 3-position switch
  CH6      | Servo Release 1  | Toggle switch / mix
  CH7      | Servo Release 2  | Toggle switch / mix
  CH8      | Servo Release 3  | Toggle switch / mix
  CH9      | Servo Release 4  | Pot/knob or mix
  CH10     | Servo Release 5  | Pot/knob or mix
  CH11     | Servo Release 6  | Pot/knob or mix (if available)
  CH12     | Spare/RTL        | Emergency switch

  MINIMUM CHANNELS NEEDED: 11 (5 flight + 6 servo releases)
  RECOMMENDED: 12+ channels

--- OPTION 1: FlySky FS-i6X + iA10B (BUDGET) ---

  Channels: 10 (with iA10B receiver)

  VERDICT: MARGINAL. Only 10 channels total.
  - 4 channels for sticks (aileron, elevator, throttle, rudder)
  - 1 channel for flight mode
  - 5 remaining channels for servo releases
  - CANNOT control all 6 servos individually!

  WORKAROUND: Use channel mixing to trigger 2 servos from 1 channel,
  or use sequential release (drop in pairs). This is not ideal.

  PWM Output: iA10B has 10 PWM output pins, so hardware supports it,
  but the TX only has 10 channels total (4 sticks + 4 switches + 2 pots).

  LIMITATION: The i6X physically has only 6 switches/knobs beyond the
  sticks, making it very difficult to individually address 6 releases
  plus flight mode.

--- OPTION 2: RadioLink AT10II + R12DS (RECOMMENDED BUDGET) ---

  Channels: 12
  Price: ~$90-120 USD

  VERDICT: ADEQUATE.
  - 12 channels provides enough for all functions
  - R12DS receiver has 12 PWM/SBUS outputs
  - Multiple switches and knobs for assignment
  - Telemetry support (battery voltage monitoring)
  - Sufficient for 5 flight channels + 6 servo + 1 spare

  NOTE: You will need to use channel mixing to map the 6 release
  channels to available switches. The AT10II has 2 sticks,
  4 toggle switches, 2 pots = enough for 6 aux channels.

--- OPTION 3: FrSky Taranis QX7 / X9D + (BEST) ---

  Channels: 16
  Price: ~$120-200 USD

  VERDICT: IDEAL.
  - 16 channels - more than enough
  - OpenTX firmware allows unlimited channel mixing
  - Programmable logic: sequential release from one switch
  - Can program a single switch to cycle through releases 1-6
  - Excellent range with XM+, X8R, or R-XSR receivers
  - Large community support for ArduPilot integration

  X9D+ has 6 switches + 2 sliders + 2 pots = abundant controls
  QX7 has 4 switches + 2 pots = still sufficient with mixing

  RECOMMENDED RECEIVER: FrSky X8R (8 PWM + 16ch SBUS)
  Or: FrSky R-XSR (SBUS output, requires FC for servo control)

--- OPTION 4: Use Flight Controller for Servo Control ---

  BEST APPROACH for 6+ servo channels:

  Instead of running servos directly from the RX, use the Pixhawk/ArduPilot
  flight controller to manage servo outputs. ArduPilot supports:

  - SERVOn_FUNCTION parameter to assign any output to a relay/servo
  - RC passthrough mode (RCn_OPTION for relay toggle)
  - Programmable servo outputs on AUX1-AUX6 pins
  - Triggered via RC channel or GCS (Ground Control Station)

  This means you only need a few RC channels for triggers:
  - 1 switch for "drop next payload" (sequential release)
  - Or 2-3 switches with mixing for individual control

  Pixhawk 2.4.8 has 6 AUX outputs (AUX1-AUX6) perfect for 6 servos!
  Main outputs 1-6 go to ESCs, AUX outputs 1-6 go to release servos.

  ArduPilot Configuration:
    SERVO9_FUNCTION = 0 (disabled) or specific relay function
    SERVO10_FUNCTION = 0
    ... through SERVO14_FUNCTION

    RCx_OPTION = 28 (Relay On/Off) for each release channel

  This is the RECOMMENDED approach. It works with ANY TX that has
  at least 7-8 channels (4 sticks + mode + 2-3 release triggers).

  MN3508 700KV       | 700 | 4S      | 12x4      | 13x4.4     | 1,360g / ~1,500g
  MN3508 700KV       | 700 | 3S      | 13x5.5    | 12x4       | ~1,100g
  2216 880KV          | 880 | 4S      | 10x4.5    | 10x3.8     | ~950g / 1,070g
  2216 880KV          | 880 | 3S      | 10x4.5    | 9x4.7      | ~650g

  PROP SELECTION RULES:
  - Lower KV = larger prop (more efficient, more thrust per watt)
  - Higher voltage = same RPM with lower current (more efficient)
  - Carbon fiber props preferred for rigidity and consistency
  - Self-tightening ("self-locking") prop adapters recommended for hex
  - Always use matched CW/CCW prop pairs

  FOR THIS BUILD (3508 380KV on 6S): Use T-Motor 15x5 CF propellers
  Weight per prop: 26.5g
  These are the T-Motor P15x5 carbon fiber props (TM-P15x5-CF)

  Hover Throttle (loaded)             | ~57%
  Hover Throttle (unloaded)           | ~31%

--- CRITICAL NOTES ---

  1. THRUST-TO-WEIGHT MARGIN: At 1.74:1 with full payload, the hex
     has limited authority for wind gusts and aggressive maneuvering.
     For safer operation, consider limiting payload to 2.5 kg (5 x 500g)
     which gives TWR of ~1.89:1, or upgrade to a larger frame (Tarot 960)
     with bigger motors (4006/4008 class).

  2. BATTERY C-RATING: At full payload, hover current is ~27A and max
     burst could reach 80A. A 10000mAh 25C battery provides 250A
     continuous, which is more than adequate.

  3. PROGRESSIVE IMPROVEMENT: As each 500g payload is released, the
     drone gets lighter, hover throttle drops, and efficiency improves.
     This is a significant advantage of the multi-drop design.

  4. FAILSAFE: Program ArduPilot Return-To-Launch (RTL) on signal loss.
     Consider geofencing to prevent flyaways.

  5. LEGAL: Check local regulations for drone weight limits. In many
     jurisdictions, drones over 250g require registration, and drones
     carrying/dropping payloads may require special permits.

  6. WIND TOLERANCE: At TWR 1.74:1, max recommended wind speed is
     approximately 15-20 km/h. Above this, control authority degrades.

--- WHY NOT OPTION B OR C? ---

  Option B (3508 700KV + 4S): Viable but less efficient. The 4S voltage
  means higher current for the same power, reducing flight time and
  requiring higher C-rate batteries. Total thrust with 12" props is
  only ~8.16 kg, giving marginal 1.26:1 TWR at 6.47 kg AUW. With 13"
  props it improves, but 6S is simply better for this motor size.

  Option C (2216 880KV + 4S): INADEQUATE. Max thrust of ~5.7 kg total
  cannot safely lift 6.47 kg AUW. These motors are designed for
  lightweight 450-class quadcopters, not heavy-lift hexacopters.
