# Phase 2 — RF Surveillance & Wireless Security Research Drone

> **LEGAL DISCLAIMER:** This phase is documented strictly for **authorized defensive security research and academic study**. Unauthorized interception of communications, wardriving without permission, and hacking into systems you don't own is **illegal under the Indian IT Act 2000 (Sections 43, 66)** and can result in imprisonment. Only conduct RF research on networks you own or have written authorization to test.

**Goal:** Add RF antennas and SDR (Software Defined Radio) capabilities to the Phase 1 drone for wireless spectrum monitoring, signal intelligence gathering, and authorized penetration testing of your own networks.
