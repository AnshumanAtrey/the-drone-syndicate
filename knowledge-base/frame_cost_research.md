# 850mm Hexacopter Frame Cost Research - India
## Custom Build vs Ready-Made (ZD850) Cost Comparison
### Compiled: February 2026

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

| Option | Estimated Total Cost (INR) | Weight | Verdict |
|--------|---------------------------|--------|---------|
| ZD850 Ready-Made (India) | Rs.10,000 - 19,500 | ~1,210g | **Best value** - proven design, tested |
| ZD850 from AliExpress | Rs.11,500 - 12,500 (~$135-140 USD) | ~1,210g | Cheapest if willing to wait 3-4 weeks |
| DIY: CF Tubes + CF Plates (CNC cut) | Rs.12,000 - 18,000 | ~800-1,200g | Comparable cost, lighter possible, more work |
| DIY: CF Tubes + 3D Printed Center (PETG) | Rs.5,000 - 8,000 | ~900-1,400g | **Cheapest DIY option** |
| DIY: CF Tubes + 3D Printed (Nylon-CF) | Rs.8,000 - 14,000 | ~850-1,300g | Good balance of cost/strength |
| Custom Aluminum Frame (CNC) | Rs.8,000 - 15,000 | ~1,800-2,500g | **Too heavy** - not recommended |
| Custom CF Frame (IndiaMART fabricator) | Rs.3,600 - 25,000 | varies | Wide range - get specific quotes |
| S550 Hexacopter (550mm) | Rs.3,500 - 4,500 | ~478g frame | **Too small** for 15" props |
| Tarot T960 (960mm) | Rs.32,500 | ~1,200g | Expensive but premium quality |

**Bottom line:** The ZD850 at Rs.10,000-13,000 from IndiaMART is hard to beat for value. A DIY build with 3D-printed center plates + carbon fiber tubes can come in at Rs.5,000-8,000 but requires significant assembly effort and design work. A full carbon fiber DIY build costs roughly the same as the ZD850.

## 2. OTHER READY-MADE HEX FRAMES

### S550 Hexacopter Frame (550mm) - TOO SMALL
- Wheelbase: 550mm
- Max prop size: 10" (NOT suitable for 15" props)
- Weight: ~478g (frame only)
- Price: Rs.3,500 - 4,500

**Verdict:** Completely unsuitable. 550mm wheelbase cannot fit 15" propellers. Adjacent motor distance is only ~275mm, far too tight.

- [S550 on IndiaMART](https://www.indiamart.com/proddetail/s550-frame-s550-hexacopter-27086642891.html)

### Tarot T960 (960mm) - PREMIUM BUT EXPENSIVE
- Wheelbase: 960mm
- Material: High-quality carbon fiber + CNC aluminum
- Foldable design
- Weight: ~1,200g
- Supports 2-3kg payload
- Price in India: Rs.32,500 (IndiaMART / Indian Robo Store)

**Verdict:** Excellent frame but Rs.32,500 is 2.5x the ZD850 price. Only justified if you need the extra 110mm of clearance or the premium Tarot build quality.

- [Tarot T960 on Indian Robo Store](https://indianrobostore.com/TAROT-T960-HEXACOPTER-KIT-p358163387)

### DJI F550 Flame Wheel (550mm) - TOO SMALL
- Wheelbase: 550mm
- Frame weight: 478g
- Max prop: 10" recommended
- Material: PA66+30GF (nylon-glass fiber, not carbon fiber)

**Verdict:** Same problem as S550. Too small for 15" props. The F550 is designed for 10" prop class.

### No Other 850mm Hex Frames Found
The ZD850 is essentially the ONLY widely available 850mm hex frame on the market. There are no cheaper 850mm alternatives from other brands. The market jumps from 550mm (S550/F550 class) to 850mm (ZD850) to 960mm (Tarot T960). There is nothing in between at a lower price point.

## 3. DIY OPTION 1: CARBON FIBER TUBES + CNC CUT CF PLATES

### Bill of Materials

#### A. Carbon Fiber Tubes for Arms (6 required)

Each arm needs to be ~300-350mm long (from center hub to motor mount). The ZD850 uses 20mm OD tubes.

**Option 1: 20mm OD x 18mm ID x 1000mm (3K Roll-wrapped)**

| Supplier | Price per tube (1m) | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| RCDhamaka | Rs.1,431 | 3K quality, reliable |
| IndiaMART (various) | Rs.1,600 - 3,575 | Wide range of suppliers |
| Indian Robo Store | Rs.800 | Possibly lower quality |
| Funique Composites (TradeIndia) | Rs.1,600 | OD 20, ID 18 |

You need 6 arms x ~350mm each = 2,100mm total. That's 3 tubes of 1000mm length (with ~30% waste for cutting).
- Using RCDhamaka: 3 x Rs.1,431 = **Rs.4,293**
- Using budget: 3 x Rs.800 = **Rs.2,400**

**Option 2: 16mm OD x 14mm ID x 1000mm (3K Roll-wrapped)**

| Supplier | Price per tube (1m) | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| RCDhamaka | Rs.1,177 (3K) / Rs.764 (standard) | |
| IndiaMART | Rs.800 - 1,500 | |
| Robu.in | ~Rs.900-1,200 (estimated) | |

Using 16mm tubes: 3 x Rs.1,177 = **Rs.3,531** (3K) or 3 x Rs.764 = **Rs.2,292** (standard)

**Recommendation:** Use 20mm OD tubes for an 850mm hex carrying 6.5kg AUW. 16mm may work but 20mm is safer for rigidity. The ZD850 uses 20mm for good reason.

- [Robu.in CF Tubes](https://robu.in/product-category/mechanical-parts-and-tools/carbon-fiber/tubes-and-rods/)

#### B. Carbon Fiber Sheets for Center Plates

You need:
- 1x Bottom plate: ~250mm diameter hexagonal or circular, 3mm thick
- 1x Top plate: ~200mm diameter, 1.5-2mm thick
- 6x Motor mount plates (if not using tube clamps): small pieces
- Fits in a 300x300mm sheet for both plates

**Carbon Fiber Sheet Prices in India:**

| Size | Thickness | Supplier | Price (INR) |
|------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 500 x 500mm | 3mm | Xbotics.in | Rs.10,030 |
| 500 x 500mm | 3mm | RCDhamaka | Rs.7,203 |
| 500 x 500mm | 3mm | IndiaMART (Avian Aerospace, Bengaluru) | Rs.6,200 |
| 500 x 500mm | 2mm | RCDhamaka | Rs.5,932 |
| 500 x 500mm | 4mm | RCDhamaka | Rs.11,694 |
| 300 x 200mm | 3mm | Robu.in | ~Rs.2,500-3,000 (estimated) |
| 250 x 100mm | 3mm | RCDhamaka | Rs.1,249 |
| 500 x 500mm | 1mm | IndiaMART (Chennai) | Rs.3,450 |
| 250 x 250mm | 1.5mm | RCDhamaka | Rs.2,034 (discounted) |

**What you actually need:**
- For center plates, a 300x300mm 3mm sheet would be sufficient for the bottom plate
- A 300x200mm 1.5mm sheet for the top plate
- Small offcuts for motor mount reinforcements

Estimated sheet cost: **Rs.3,000 - 5,000** (one 300x300x3mm + one 300x200x1.5mm)

#### C. CNC Cutting Service

**India-based CNC cutting for carbon fiber:**
- DayoAir offers custom CNC cutting, pricing based on complexity and working hours
- Send DXF/DWG files to get quotes
- Lead time: ~5 days
- Estimated cost for 2 plates (center bottom + top): **Rs.1,500 - 3,000**

Alternatively, if you buy a sheet and take it to a local CNC shop:
- CNC machining in India: Rs.800 - 2,000/hour
- Cutting 2 drone plates from carbon fiber: ~1-2 hours = **Rs.1,000 - 3,000**

**WARNING:** CNC cutting carbon fiber produces hazardous dust. The shop must have proper dust extraction and the operators need respiratory protection. Not all workshops will accept this job.

## 4. DIY OPTION 2: CF TUBES + 3D PRINTED CENTER PLATES (PETG/NYLON)

### 3D Printing Costs in India

| Material | Cost per gram | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| PLA | Rs.3 - 8/gram | Not recommended - brittle, heat-sensitive |
| PETG | Rs.8 - 15/gram | Good balance of strength and cost |
| ABS | Rs.8 - 15/gram | Similar to PETG, needs enclosure |
| Nylon (PA12) | Rs.45 - 80/gram | Excellent strength, expensive |
| PETG-CF (carbon filled) | Rs.15 - 25/gram | Best strength/weight for FDM |
| Nylon-CF | Rs.30 - 50/gram | Premium option |

**Center plate weight estimate:**
- Bottom plate (250mm hex, 3mm wall, with cutouts): ~80-120g in PETG
- Top plate (200mm, 2mm wall, with cutouts): ~40-60g in PETG
- 6x Motor mount adapters: ~10g each = 60g
- Total printed parts: ~180-240g

**3D Printing cost:**
- PETG: 200g x Rs.12/g = **Rs.2,400**
- PETG-CF: 200g x Rs.20/g = **Rs.4,000**
- Nylon-CF: 200g x Rs.40/g = **Rs.8,000**

If you own a 3D printer, material cost only:
- PETG filament: ~Rs.1,500-2,000/kg, so 200g = **Rs.300-400**
- PETG-CF filament: ~Rs.3,199/kg (IndiaMART), so 200g = **Rs.640**

Sources:

- [PETG-CF Filament Rs.3,199/kg](https://www.indiamart.com/proddetail/petg-carbon-fiber-filament-21117549997.html)
- [3D Printing Service Pricing](https://printmyparts.io/blog-posts/how-much-does-3d-printing-cost/)

### TOTAL: CF Tubes + 3D Printed (Using printing service)

| Component | PETG (Service) | PETG-CF (Service) | PETG (Own Printer) |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| CF Tubes (6 arms) | Rs.2,400 - 4,300 | Rs.2,400 - 4,300 | Rs.2,400 - 4,300 |
| 3D Printed plates | Rs.2,400 | Rs.4,000 | Rs.300 - 640 |
| Hardware + landing gear | Rs.2,100 - 3,800 | Rs.2,100 - 3,800 | Rs.2,100 - 3,800 |
| **TOTAL** | **Rs.6,900 - 10,500** | **Rs.8,500 - 12,100** | **Rs.4,800 - 8,740** |

**Pros:**
- Cheapest option (especially with own printer)
- Easy to iterate and reprint broken parts
- Can design custom mounting points for FC, GPS, battery
- Quick turnaround (1-2 days printing)

**Cons:**
- PETG is not as stiff as carbon fiber plate - may flex under heavy loads
- Nylon-CF is better but expensive when using a service
- UV degradation over time (less concern for CF-filled variants)
- Vibration damping may be better (softer material) or worse (resonance)
- Crash durability is lower than solid CF plate

**Design tip:** Print with 4-6 perimeter walls, 40-60% gyroid infill, and 0.2mm layer height for best strength. Use PETG-CF if possible.

## 5. DIY OPTION 3: CUSTOM ALUMINUM FRAME

### Material Cost

| Material | Price per kg | Density | Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------|
| Aluminum 6061-T6 sheet, 3mm | Rs.260 - 350/kg | 2.7 g/cm3 | Common, easy to machine |
| Carbon fiber sheet, 3mm | ~Rs.25,000-30,000/kg equiv | 1.6 g/cm3 | 40% lighter than aluminum |

A 500x500x3mm aluminum 6061 plate weighs: 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.003 x 2700 = 2.025 kg
Same in carbon fiber: 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.003 x 1600 = 1.2 kg

**Aluminum plate cost (500x500x3mm):** ~Rs.500-700 (2kg at Rs.260-350/kg)

### CNC Machining

- CNC hourly rate in India: Rs.800 - 2,000/hour
- Estimated machining time for 2 plates: 2-3 hours
- Machining cost: **Rs.2,000 - 6,000**

**But aluminum is too heavy for arms.** You would still need CF tubes for the arms, so the aluminum only replaces the center plates.

### TOTAL: Aluminum Center Plates + CF Tube Arms

| Component | Low | High |
|-----------|-----|------|
| Aluminum sheet (raw material) | Rs.500 | Rs.700 |
| CNC machining | Rs.2,000 | Rs.6,000 |
| CF Tubes (6 arms) | Rs.2,400 | Rs.4,300 |
| Hardware + landing gear | Rs.2,100 | Rs.3,800 |
| **TOTAL** | **Rs.7,000** | **Rs.14,800** |

**Weight penalty:** Aluminum center plates would weigh ~400-600g vs ~200-300g for carbon fiber. Total frame weight would be ~1,500-2,000g vs ~800-1,200g for all-CF.

**Verdict:** NOT recommended. The weight penalty of aluminum is significant for a hexacopter targeting under 1,500g frame weight. The cost savings over carbon fiber plates are minimal (Rs.2,000-4,000) but you add 200-400g of unnecessary weight. Use carbon fiber or 3D-printed plates instead.

## 9. RECOMMENDATIONS

### If budget is the primary concern:
**Go with DIY CF Tubes + 3D Printed center plates (PETG-CF)**
- Cost: Rs.5,000-8,000 (with own printer: Rs.3,000-5,000)
- You sacrifice the folding arm feature and proven design
- Good if you enjoy the build process and have CAD skills
- Easy to iterate and improve

### If reliability and time are the primary concern:
**Buy the ZD850 from IndiaMART at Rs.10,000-13,000**
- Proven design with thousands of users
- Folding arms for transport
- Correct motor mounting for 3508 class
- Landing gear included
- Weight within target (1,210g)
- You can fly within a day of receiving it

### If you want the lightest possible frame:
**Go with full DIY CF (CNC cut plates + CF tubes)**
- Potential to get under 900g with optimized design
- Most expensive DIY option but comparable to ZD850 price
- Requires significant engineering effort
- No folding arms unless you add CNC aluminum hinges (more cost and weight)

### If you want premium quality:
**Buy the Tarot T960 at Rs.32,500**
- Best build quality and engineering
- 960mm gives even more prop clearance
- Foldable, professional-grade hardware
- Only if budget allows

### NOT Recommended:
- **Aluminum frame** - Too heavy, negates the purpose
- **S550 frame** - Too small for 15" props
- **Buying from AliExpress** - Only saves Rs.1,000-2,000 over IndiaMART but adds 3-4 weeks shipping and customs uncertainty

## 10. SUGGESTED HYBRID APPROACH (BEST VALUE)

**Buy ZD850 from IndiaMART (Rs.10,000-13,000) + 3D print custom mounting plates**

This gives you:
1. Proven, tested carbon fiber frame with folding arms
2. Custom 3D-printed mounting plates for your specific FC, GPS, battery layout
3. Landing gear included
4. Under 1,500g total frame weight
5. Ability to customize without redesigning the entire frame
6. Spare parts available if arms break

The 3D-printed additions (FC mount plate, GPS mast adapter, battery tray) would cost only Rs.200-500 in PETG material and can be tailored exactly to your components.

This is the approach most serious drone builders in India use - buy a proven frame and customize the mounting.
