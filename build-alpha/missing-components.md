# Missing Components — Build Alpha

We are building a 6-arm hexacopter drone that carries 6 payloads of 500g each (3kg total) and drops them individually via RC remote and mobile app. The frame is ZD850 850mm, flight controller is Matek H743-WING V3, and motors are T-Motor MN3508 380KV on 6S power.

We already have the following from Robokits: motors, ESCs, servos, batteries, GPS, charger, connectors, and wires.

We need the following additional items. Please let us know if each is available, and if not, what alternative you can offer that meets the same spec.

## Still Needed from Robokits

1. Heat Shrink Tube 3mm Black — 3 meters
2. Heat Shrink Tube 5mm Black — 2 meters
3. Heat Shrink Tube 8mm Yellow — 2 meters
4. Servo Extension Cable 12 inch Male-Female — 6 pieces

## From Indian Robo Store

5. Matek H743-WING V3 Flight Controller — 1 piece
   (Needs minimum 13 PWM outputs, built-in 8A servo BEC, official ArduPilot support. Do not substitute with HPXGRC H743 or similar unknown brands.)

6. 15x5 Carbon Fibre Propellers (also written as 1550) — 4 pairs
   (T-Motor MN3508 rated prop. Do NOT substitute with 15x5.5 or 1555 — those exceed motor current rating.)

7. ZD850 850mm Carbon Fibre Hexacopter Frame — 1 piece
   (Needs to support 6kg+ payload class, 20mm CF arms, foldable preferred. Minimum 200mm ground clearance with landing gear.)

## From Amazon / Local

8. 24V 400W DC Power Supply with XT60 output — 1 piece
   (Required to power the ISDT Q6 Retro charger. The charger is DC-only and will not work without this.)

9. GPS Mast 15 to 20cm height — 1 piece

10. Wide Velcro Straps — 3 pieces

11. Non-slip Battery Pad — 1 piece

12. LiPo Safe Charging Bag — 1 piece

17. Soldering Iron — 1 piece
    (If not available locally, any 40W+ iron with fine tip works.)

## For Remote and App Control (RC + Telemetry)

18. RC Transmitter minimum 10 channels — 1 piece
    (We need at least 6 dedicated switches for payload release on channels 7 to 12.)

19. Compatible RC Receiver for above transmitter — 1 piece

20. Telemetry Radio Pair 433MHz or 915MHz — 1 set
    (For real-time connection between drone and mobile app via Mission Planner or similar.)
